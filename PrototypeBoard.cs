//In general all text in a code file that is not code must be preceded by two forward leaning slashes as you see in this comment
//If you have any questions on any of the words I use please send me an emall with your question and I will amplify on my instructions

//The first section of a code file is the declararion of namespaces that will be imported from the .NET runtime library.  
//we always use the System namesapce  this has very basic capabilities and classes that are used everywwhere
//In addition we use the  Linq class so we can manipulate colections of objects.  The Diagnostics namespace brings in basic 
//items such as the assert function that allows us to test assumptions made bout the inout oparameters to a function
